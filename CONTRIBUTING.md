# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in improving [faucet.celo.org](https://faucet.celo.org/).

If you want to contribute, but aren't sure where to start, you can create a

There are multiple opportunities to contribute. It doesn't matter if you are just
getting started or are an expert. We appreciate your interest in contributing.

> **IMPORTANT**
> Please ask before starting work on any significant new features.

## Basic guide

This guide is intended to help you get started with contributing. By following these steps,
you will understand the development process and workflow.

### Cloning the repository

To start contributing to the project, clone it to your local machine using git:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/celo-org/faucet.git
```

Navigate to the project's root directory:

```sh
$ cd faucet
```

### Installing Node.js

We use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run the project locally.
You need to install the **Node.js version** specified in [.nvmrc](../.nvmrc). To do so, run:

```sh
$ nvm install
$ nvm use
```

### Installing dependencies

Once in the project's root directory, run the following command to install the project's
dependencies:

```sh
$ yarn install
```

After installing the dependencies, the project is ready to be run.

### Navigating the repository

The project is structured into two apps located in the [`apps/`](./apps/) directory.

1. The firebase app contains functions which do the actual fauceting.
2. The web app contains a UI for making requests.

### Running packages

Once you navigated to the package directory you want to run, inspect the `package.json` file
and look for the `scripts` section. It contains the list of available scripts that can be run.

### Running the test suite

Unfortunately, we don't have a consistent testing suite for the faucet.
This is something we are working on improving.

When you open a Pull Request, the GitHub CI will run any available test suites for you, but
you can also add and run tests locally.

> **INFO**
> Some tests are run automatically when you open a Pull Request, while others are run when a
> maintainer approves the Pull Request. This is for security reasons, as some tests require access
> to secrets.

### Open a Pull Request

âœ… Now you're ready to contribute to Celo SDK(s) and CLI(s)!
