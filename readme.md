# Welcome to Alfajores Faucet app

This Repo contains the code for the alfajores faucet. This is contained in 2 apps.

- The firebase app contains functions which do the actual fauceting.

- The web app contains a UI for making requests.

The web app deploys automatically to vercel.

## Setup

### Wep app

To set up the web app to run locally:

1.  navigate to the `apps/web` folder

    ```sh
    $ cd apps/web
    ```

1.  link your local repository to the `faucet` project on Vercel

    ```sh
    $ yarn dlx vercel@latest link
    ```

    You'll be asked to authenticate with your Vercel account. Once you've done that, you'll be
    guided through a series of prompts to link your local project to the `faucet` Vercel project.

    ```
    ? Set up “~/Documents/celo-org/faucet/apps/web”? [Y/n] y
    ? Which scope should contain your project? Celo Ecosystem Project Hosting
    ? Link to existing project? [y/N] y
    ? What’s the name of your existing project? faucet
    ✅  Linked to c-labs/faucet (created .vercel)
    ```

1.  fetch environment variables from Vercel

    ```sh
    $ yarn dlx vercel@latest env pull
    ```

    If you get an error like `Error! No project found`, you may need to run `vercel link` again.
    If everything worked, you should see a message like this:

    ```sh
    > Downloading `development` Environment Variables for Project faucet
    ✅  Created .env.local file  [249ms]
    ```

1.  run the app locally

    ```sh
    $ yarn dev
    ```

    You should see a message like this:

    ```sh
    ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
    info  - Loaded env from /Users/arthur/Documents/celo-org/faucet/apps/web/.env.local
    ```

    You can now view the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

## Firebase app

To set up the firebase app to run locally:

1.  navigate to the `apps/firebase` folder
    ```sh
    $ cd apps/firebase
    ```
1.  login to firebase
    ```sh
    $ yarn dlx firebase-tools@latest login
    ```
    You'll be asked to authenticate with your Firebase account.
1.  build the firebase app
    ```sh
    $ yarn run preserve
    ```
1.  ensure that you are on required node version specified in `engines.node` in
    `firebase/package.json`. Currently this is Node 20 at the time of writing.
    ```sh
    $ nvm use <the-required-node-version>
    ```
1.  run the firebase app locally
    ```sh
    $ yarn run serve
    ```

## Adding chains

### Web

- Add the chain config and token info to `config/chains.ts`.

- Add chain name to the networks array, and `ChainId` and `FaucetAddress` to enums in `types/index.ts`.

### Firebase

In the `apps/firebase` project run `yarn cli config:set` with the relevant params.
